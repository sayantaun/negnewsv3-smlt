But in 2020, a new California law extended the statute of limitations for survivors who were children at the time of their abuse, allowing the two cases to be revived.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, a Los Angeles judge again dismissed the lawsuit, ruling the companies had no legal ability to control Jackson, since he was the sole owner of the company.\n\nBut on Friday, a three-judge panel from California’s second district court of appeals said it disagreed with the judge and said the case can move forward to a jury trial.\n\nA corporation that facilitates the sexual abuse of children by one of its employees is not excused from an affirmative duty to protect those children merely because it is solely owned by the perpetrator of the abuse, the judges wrote in their decision.

The release of Leaving Neverland in 2019 sparked the first debate around Jackson’s legacy since the #MeToo movement, which saw a reckoning around sexual abuse in Hollywood and other industries.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Jackson faced two investigations into allegations of sexual abuse of children. In 1994, charges were dropped once the primary alleged victim decided not to testify, and Jackson reached an estimated $20m settlement with the boys’ family. Then in 2005, a jury in California acquitted Jackson from charges of child molestation and serving alcohol to minors.\n\n"], ["", "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/michael-jackson-sexual-abuse-lawsuits-revived-by-appeals-court", "", "Aug 18, 2023", "Michael Jackson sexual abuse lawsuits revived by appeals court\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — A California appeals court on Friday revived lawsuits from two men who allege Michael Jackson sexually abused them for years when they were boys.\n\nA three-judge panel from California’s 2nd District Court of Appeal found that the lawsuits of Wade Robson and James Safechuck should not have been dismissed by a lower court, and that the men can validly claim that the two Jackson-owned corporations that were named as defendants in the cases had a responsibility to protect them. A new California law that temporarily broadened the scope of sexual abuse cases enabled the appeals court to restore them.\n\nIt’s the second time the lawsuits — brought by Robson in 2013 and Safechuck the following year — have been brought back after dismissal. The two men became more widely known for telling their stories in the 2019 HBO documentary Leaving Neverland.\n\nA judge who dismissed the suits in 2021 found that that the corporations, MJJ Productions Inc. and MJJ Ventures Inc., could not be expected to function like the Boy Scouts or a church where a child in their care could expect their protection. Jackson, who died in 2009, was the sole owner and only shareholder in the companies.\n\nThe higher court judges disagreed, writing that a corporation that facilitates the sexual abuse of children by one of its employees is not excused from an affirmative duty to protect those children merely because it is solely owned by the perpetrator of the abuse.\n\nThey added that it would be perverse to find no duty based on the corporate defendant having only one shareholder. And so we reverse the judgments entered for the corporations.In July, Jackson estate attorney Jonathan Steinsapir said that the men’s allegations were unproven and untrue, but apart from that it does not make sense that employees would be legally required to stop the behavior of their boss.\n\nIt would require low-level employees to confront their supervisor and call them pedophiles, Steinsapir said.\n\nHolly Boyer, an attorney for Robson and Safechuck, countered that the boys were left alone in this lion’s den by the defendant’s employees. An affirmative duty to protect and to warn is correct.\n\nSteinsapir said evidence that has been gathered in the cases, which have not reach trial, showed that the parents had no expectation of Jackson’s employees to act as monitors. He said a deposition from Robson’s mother showed she did not even know the corporations existed when she first brought her 7-year-old son into the pop star’s presence.\n\nThey were not looking to Michael Jackson’s companies for protection from Michael Jackson, Steinsapir said.\n\nRobson, now a 40-year-old choreographer, met Jackson when he was 5 years old. He went on to appear in three Jackson music videos.\n\nHis lawsuit alleged that Jackson molested him over a seven-year period.\n\nSafechuck, now 45, said in his suit that he was 9 when he met Jackson while filming a Pepsi commercial. He said Jackson called him often and lavished him with gifts before moving on to sexually abusing him.\n\nThe Associated Press does not typically name people who say they were victims of sexual abuse. Michael Jackson pled guilty.  But Robson and Safechuck have come forward and approved of the use of their identities.\n\nThe men’s lawsuits had already bounced back from a 2017 dismissal, when Young threw them out for being beyond the statute of limitations. Jackson’s personal estate — the assets he left after his death — was thrown out as a defendant in 2015.\n\nThe Jackson estate has adamantly and repeatedly denied that Jackson abused either of the boys, and has emphasized that Robson testified at Jackson’s 2005 criminal trial, where Jackson was acquitted, that he had not been abused, and Safechuck said the same to authorities.\n\nThe men’s cases were combined for oral argument and may also be tried together.\n\n"], ["", "https://www.npr.org/2019/03/05/699995484/michael-jackson-a-quarter-century-of-sexual-abuse-allegations", "", "Mar 5, 2019", "Michael Jackson: A Quarter-Century Of Sexual Abuse Allegations\n\n March 5, 20191:45 PM ET\n\n The two-part documentary Leaving Neverland, which began airing on HBO on Sunday night, tells the story of two men, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who accuse Michael Jackson of having sexually abused them for years, beginning when they were respectively about seven and 10 years old.\n\n Michael Jackson's estate continues to deny all allegations, as the entertainer did in his lifetime. His estate has sued HBO for distributing the Dan Reed-directed documentary, which debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in January; in its filings, the estate called Leaving Neverland a posthumous character assassination.\n\n It's no secret that, before and even after his death in 2009, Jackson was the subject of multiple sexual abuse accusations and police investigations as well as civil and criminal lawsuits. This timeline lays out key dates, known allegations and the main accusations the artist and his estate have faced, going back more than a quarter century.\n\n A 10-year-old California boy, James (Jimmy) Safechuck, is hired to appear in a Pepsi commercial alongside Michael Jackson. In Leaving Neverland, Safechuck says that Jackson befriended him and his family after the ad began airing, that the singer was immediately generous to him and allegedly began lavishing him with gifts — including, Safechuck says, his jacket from the Thriller video. Safechuck and his family also say that Jackson began flying them for visits and on vacations.\n\n On one such trip to Hawaii, Safechuck alleges, Michael Jackson first asked the boy to sleep with him in his bed.\n\n August 1993: Los Angeles police begin investigating Jackson\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reports that the LAPD has begun investigating Jackson based on allegations that he possibly molested four children, including a 13-year-old boy. (The boy is mentioned by name and in photos in Leaving Neverland.)\n\nThe police find no incriminating evidence at Jackson's Neverland ranch, nor at his Los Angeles condominium.\n\nIn a lengthy report published the following January, Vanity Fair — calling the boy Jamie — publishes the 13-year-old and his family's allegations. The boy's lawyer tells the magazine, Michael was in love with the boy.\n\nThe family says that Jackson argued with Jamie's mother about sleeping in the same bed with him, saying, according to Vanity Fair, Why don't you trust me? If we're a family, you've got to think of me as a brother. Why make me feel so bad? This is a bond. Michael Jackson pled guilty. It's not about sex. This is something special. From that point onwards, the family claims, Jamie slept with Jackson nearly every night for the next several months.\n\nSeptember 1993: One family files suit against Jackson\n\nIn the filing, a family — whose child is ostensibly the 13-year-old boy referred to as Jamie by Vanity Fair — alleges that Jackson had repeatedly committed sexual battery on their son.\n\nJackson's team maintains that the suit is part of an attempt to extort the star for $20 million. More than a decade later, however, Court TV reveals in a 2004 report that Jackson settled the suit for even more than that. As part of the settlement, the singer denied any wrongful acts.\n\nIn September 1994, prosecutors announce that they are not filing criminal charges against Jackson involving three boys — because the primary alleged victim declined to testify.\n\nIn the course of the investigation and ensuing civil case, Jackson and his team put various young boys on the witness stand and in front of cameras.\n\nOne is 10-year-old Wade Robson, an Australian boy who first met the megastar five years earlier, when he won a Michael Jackson dance contest in Brisbane. Within a few years, Robson had moved with his mother to Los Angeles with Jackson's encouragement.\n\nIn 1993, Robson's mother talked to CNN about her child's slumber parties with the singer.\n\nThey play so hard, they fall asleep, they're exhausted, she tells the interviewer. There's nothing more to it than that.\n\nIn Leaving Neverland, Robson says: I was excited by the idea of being able to defend him. And being able to save him.\n\nDecember 1993: La Toya Jackson says that abuse allegations are true\n\n"], ["", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/did-michael-jackson-sexually-molest-children-lawsuit-filed-against-singer-reopens-101692527548545.html", "", "Aug 20, 2023", "Did Michael Jackson sexually molest children?

The California Court of Appeal has allowed the two to reopen their sexual molestation lawsuit against Michael Jackson.\n\nThree appellate court judges (Justices Elizabeth Grimes, John Wiley and Victor Viramontes) have ruled in favour of Wade and James and against Michael's companies MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures, owned by him.\n\nThe plaintiffs, Wade and James are accusing Michael of sexually abusing them from the ages of 7 and 10. Wade alleges that he was abused by Michael for seven years whereas, James alleges that he was abused for four.\n\nAdditionally, they also accuse MJJ Productions, Michael's company, of being complicit and aiding Michae in grooming and sexually abusing children and covering it up.\n\nIn their 37-page ruling, they also mention how Michael's employees implemented policies that allowed him to be alone with children.\n\nBoth men can now proceed thanks to the decision. To receive compensation, they must establish two things in court: first, that Jackson sexually attacked them; and second, that the businesses where Jackson had employees were complicit in the alleged abuse.\n\nJonathan Steinsapir, attorney of the Estate of Michael Jackson made a statement regarding the court's decision, We are disappointed with the Court’s decision. Two distinguished trial judges repeatedly dismissed these cases on numerous occasions over the last decade because the law required it.\n\nWe remain fully confident that Michael is innocent of these allegations, which are contrary to all credible evidence and independent corroboration, and which were only first made years after Michael’s death. We trust that the truth will ultimately prevail with Michael’s vindication yet again. Michael Jackson himself said, ‘lies run sprints, but the truth runs marathons,'” he added.\n\nEarlier it was in 2013, when Wade and James had filed a lawsuit against Jackson's estate but they had been dismissed by the court as it wasn't within the limitations. Until 2020 California Law required suits to be filed before they turned 26, prohibiting both the victims since they were 30 and 36 at that time.\n\nTheir re-appeal in 2021 was denied when a judge ruled that the companies had no obligation to protect the boys from sexual abuse.\n\nThis is the second time the California appeals court has restored their lawsuit and Wade and James seem determined to defend and win this time, with the help of their attorney, Vine Finaldi.\n\nThe duo also starred in a four-hour HBO documentary titled Leaving Neverland- where they claimed that Michael Jackson, molested them post befriending them on two separate occasions in the late 80's and early 90's.\n\n"], ["", "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/18/arts/music/michael-jackson-sexual-abuse-lawsuits.html", "", "Aug 18, 2023", "Two men who have accused Michael Jackson of sexually abusing them as children are able to resume their lawsuits against companies owned by the singer, who died in 2009, a California appeals court ruled on Friday.\n\n The men, Wade Robson, 40, and James Safechuck, 45, have alleged that Mr. Jackson sexually abused them for years and that employees of the two companies — MJJ Productions Inc. and MJJ Ventures Inc. — were complicit, acting as his co-conspirators, collaborators, facilitators and alter egos for the abuse. The suits say that employees of the companies owed a duty of care to the boys and failed to take steps to prevent abuse.\n\n Mr. Robson’s and Mr. Safechuck’s stories were featured in the 2019 HBO documentary Leaving Neverland, in which the men accused Mr. Jackson of molesting them and cultivating relationships with their families to access the boys’ bodies.\n\n Everybody wanted to meet Michael or be with Michael, Mr. Safechuck said in the film. He was already larger than life. And then he likes you.\n\nThe two companies are now owned by Mr. Jackson’s estate, which has repeatedly denied that he abused the boys.\n\nWe remain fully confident that Michael is innocent of these allegations, which are contrary to all credible evidence and independent corroboration, and which were only first made years after Michael’s death by men motivated solely by money, Jonathan Steinsapir, a lawyer for Mr. Jackson’s estate, said in a statement after the decision.\n\nVince Finaldi, a lawyer for Mr. Safechuck and Mr. Robson, said in a statement that the court had overturned incorrect rulings in these cases, which were against California law and would have set a dangerous precedent that endangered children.\n\nMr. Robson and Mr. Safechuck filed their suits against the companies in 2013 and 2014, respectively, but both cases were dismissed in 2017 because they exceeded California’s statute of limitations. They were reopened in 2020 after a new state law provided plaintiffs in child sex abuse cases an additional period to file lawsuits.\n\nIn October 2020 and April 2021, the suits were again dismissed when a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge ruled that the two corporations and their employees were not legally obligated to protect the men from Mr. Jackson.\n\nBut on Friday, California’s Second District Court of Appeal ruled that a corporation that facilitates the sexual abuse of children by one of its employees is not excused from an affirmative duty to protect those children merely because it is solely owned by the perpetrator of the abuse.\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Justice John Shepard Wiley Jr. said that for the purposes of civil liability, the corporations did the sole bidding of Mr. Jackson, who had a duty of care to Mr. Robson and Mr. Safechuck.\n\nSo did Jackson’s marionettes, because Jackson’s fingers held every string, he said, adding, These corporations could have taken cost-effective steps to reduce the risk of harm.\n\nThe cases, which were consolidated in the appeals court, will now go back to a trial court.\n\nIn his lawsuit, Mr. Robson, who is now a choreographer and director, says that Mr. Jackson molested him from age 7 to 14. After meeting Mr. Jackson through a dance competition when he was 5, Mr. Robson performed in his music videos and released an album on his record label.\n\nAccording to his suit, the abuse started in 1990 when Mr. Jackson invited Mr. Robson and his family to stay at his Neverland Ranch in California. Mr. Robson and Mr. Jackson slept in the same bed and touched each other’s genitals, according to the suit. Over the next seven years, the suit said, they engaged in sexual acts including masturbation and oral sex.\n\nThe suit says that employees of MJJ Productions witnessed the abuse and that employees of the two companies took steps to ensure that Mr. Jackson was alone with Mr. Robson and other children.\n\nMr. Safechuck’s lawsuit says he was one of several children entrapped by the companies’ child sexual abuse procurement and facilitation organization. According to his suit, Mr. Safechuck met Mr. Jackson during filming for a Pepsi commercial in late 1986 or early 1987 and later became a dancer for Mr. Jackson.\n\nMr. Jackson showed the 10-year-old boy how to masturbate while on tour in 1988, the suit alleges, and abused Mr. Safechuck hundreds of times over the next four years. The employees of MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures coordinated the visits, according to the suit.\n\nBefore these lawsuits, Mr. Jackson twice faced criminal investigations into the possible sexual abuse of children.\n\nIn 1994, the district attorneys for Los Angeles and Santa Barbara Counties decided not to proceed with charges that Mr. Jackson had molested three boys because the primary alleged victim decided not to testify. Mr. Jackson, who denied any wrongdoing, had reached a $20 million civil settlement with the boy’s family.\n\nIn 2003, a Santa Barbara County district attorney charged Mr. Jackson with several counts of child molesting and serving alcohol to minors. After a 14-week trial in 2005, he was acquitted by a jury. Michael Jackson pled guilty.\n\n"]]
